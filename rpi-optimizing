Disable Onboard LEDs

⚡️ Power Saved? Approximately 10mA. ⚡️

We can disable the onboard LEDs on the Pi by again editing the /boot/config.txt file, adding the following, and rebooting:

[pi4]
# Disable the PWR LED
dtparam=pwr_led_trigger=none
dtparam=pwr_led_activelow=off
# Disable the Activity LED
dtparam=act_led_trigger=none
dtparam=act_led_activelow=off
# Disable ethernet port LEDs
dtparam=eth_led0=4
dtparam=eth_led1=4

Please note that these configurations are specific to the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B!

Clock Down the CPU

⚡️ Power Saved? Varies! ⚡️

If you don’t require the full power of the Raspberry Pi CPU (which is overkill for many remote monitoring situations anyway), you might save a few mA by “underclocking” the CPU.

For example, to set the CPU clock speed to a maximum of 900MHz, you could update /boot/config.txt and change the following parameters:

[all]
arm_freq=900
arm_freq_max=900

You can also play around with the core_freq_min, over_voltage, over_voltage_min, and many other parameters that are well documented in the Raspberry Pi overclocking options.

Please note that you may not see power savings in certain scenarios. For example, if you have a process that runs longer at a slower clock speed, versus shorter at a faster clock speed, you’re not going to see a net change in power consumption.

Disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth

⚡️ Power Saved? Approximately 40mA. ⚡️

If your solution isn’t using Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, you can likely disable them.

    If you disable HDMI, USB, and Wi-Fi at the same time you’ll have trouble interfacing with your Pi!

To disable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, open /boot/config.txt, add these parameters, and reboot:

[all]
dtoverlay=disable-wifi
dtoverlay=disable-bt

To re-enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth (or just one of them), simply remove the parameter(s) from the file and reboot.

Disable the USB Controller

⚡️ Power Saved? Approximately 100mA. ⚡️

If you’re running your Raspberry Pi in a headless configuration, it’s likely you can get away with not powering the onboard USB controller. Note that even if you aren’t using a mouse or keyboard, they are still powered!

To disable the USB controller on your Raspberry Pi, execute the following command:

echo '1-1' |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind

And then to re-enable the USB controller when it’s needed again:

echo '1-1' |sudo tee /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind

After a reboot the USB controller will be enabled automatically.
Disable HDMI Output

⚡️ Power Saved? Approximately 30mA. ⚡️

Again on a headless Pi you, by definition, don’t need to hook up a monitor. If that’s the case, you can also disable the HDMI output.

To disable the HDMI output on your Raspberry Pi, execute the following command:

sudo /opt/vc/bin/tvservice -o

And then to re-enable the HDMI output when you need it back again, use this command:

sudo /opt/vc/bin/tvservice -p

As with disabling the USB controller, HDMI output is enabled after a reboot.
